# Check out what I'm doing now

I'm going on my 2nd year of living in Tokyo with my wonderful partner.
Before this, we lived in Kyoto for 3 years and studied Japanese at the Kyoto Institute of Culture and Language.
Even after 5 years in Japan, the small things are still exciting,
nothing feels mundane, and everyday I'm learning something new!

## Learning new things 🧠

- I've been having a lot of fun learning [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) ⭐, a statically-typed, functional language with a focus on simplicity. It compiles to Erlang and Javascript.
  You should totally go through the language tour on the website, and then I recommend checking out the Gleam track over on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/gleam).
- After spending a few weeks studying, I'm happy to report that I passed the
  [Google Cloud Certified Professional Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.credly.com/badges/1b121c72-48ab-4b75-b99f-51d6209c40f0) exam! 🎉

## Books I'm reading 📚

- [The Sign for Home](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58438605-the-sign-for-home)
  by [Blair Fell](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21621486.Blair_Fell)
- [Children of Memory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60850767-children-of-memory)
  by [Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1445909.Adrian_Tchaikovsky)

## Shows I'm watching 📺

- [Scavengers Reign](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21056886/) - If you like sci-fi, this animated series is a must-watch.
  I suggest you don't look up anything about it and just go in blind. 🤯 💯

## Awesome Board Games 🎲

## Health and Fitness Goals 💪✨

As I recover from surgery for a herniated disc in my lower back, I've been working on building strength through physical therapy exercises. I'm also investing in ergonomic furniture and tools to help me keep good posture while hacking all day at my desk.
